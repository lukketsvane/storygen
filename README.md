# StoryGen üìñ
StoryGen lets users generate personalized, engaging, and creative stories for children.

## How it Works
Create unique stories: Provide a brief description of elements to be included in the story, such as characters, settings, actions, or other ideas.
Produce a story: By pressing the "Generate Story" button, AI technology uses the description to generate a unique and engaging story.
Try your luck: If you're unsure what to write, you can press the "Try My Luck" button to fill the text field with a randomly selected sample text, which is then used to generate a story.

## Setup
You'll need an OpenAI API key, which you can get [here](https://openai.com/).
You'll also need a StoryGen API key, which you can get on our website.
Add those two keys to a new file named .env, following the .envExample structure.
That's it! You're ready to go! üöÄ

## Run it Locally
Open the terminal
Run `npm install` to grab the necessary packages
Hit `npm run dev` to start your server on http://localhost:3000
Having trouble? Make sure you have Node.js installed, and that you're running the latest version of npm. Otherwise open an issue and we'll help you out!

## Deploy to the World
Push all your changes to Github (or another git provider)
Head to [vercel.app](https://vercel.com/), import your repo, and hit deploy
Go to settings of the deployment, add your .env, and rebuild
Not working? Double check your Vercel logs, if there's any timeouts you may need to change plans. You can also host this on your own server!

Congratulations! You're off localhost üòÅ
